## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### **1. Basic Troubleshooting with Historical Context**
```bash
User: "My pods are crashing with CrashLoopBackOff"

System Response:
🧠 HISTORICAL INTELLIGENCE:
• Pattern Match: Kubernetes Pod Crashloop (92% confidence)
• Historical Occurrences: 3 times in past week
• Predicted Root Cause: Configuration Error
• Success Rate: 89% with config fix approach

🔮 PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS:
Based on historical patterns, this issue typically resolves with:
1. Configuration validation and correction (90% success)
2. Resource limit adjustment (75% success)
3. Image and dependency verification (80% success)
```

### **2. Proactive Issue Prevention**
```bash
Query: "System health check with trend analysis"

System Response:
📈 TREND ANALYSIS:
• Trend Direction: Worsening
• Recent Issues (24h): 5 (above normal baseline of 2)
• Predicted Next Issue: Memory Pressure (confidence: 73%)

🚨 PROACTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Monitor memory usage trends - approaching critical threshold
• Consider scaling resources before peak usage periods
• Review memory-intensive applications for optimization
```

### **3. Historical Pattern Learning**
```bash
Query: "What patterns suggest disk space issues?"
