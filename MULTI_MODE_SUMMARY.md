class OperationalMode(Enum):
    DEBUG = "debug"
    REMEDIATION = "remediation" 
    INTERACTIVE = "interactive"
    MONITORING = "monitoring"

Each mode has tailored settings:
```python
def get_mode_config(mode):
    configs = {

            "auto_remediation": False,
            "confidence_threshold": 95,
            "automation_level": AutomationLevel.MANUAL
        },
        "remediation": {
            "auto_remediation": True,
            "confidence_threshold": 85,
            "automation_level": AutomationLevel.FULL_AUTO
        }
        # ... other modes
    }
```
